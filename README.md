# manjaro-gnome-setup-script
Bash Script to Set Up a Fresh Install of Manjaro GNOME with Linux 5.7.


# Documentation

Version 2.3

Supported Linux Kernel Versions: Linux 5.7

Expect a new release at least every time Manjaro GNOME upgrades to a new major kernel version but don't rerun the script.

If you go through a major kernel upgrade in the future, please upgrade virtualbox-host-modules to the appropriate version. ONLY DO THIS IF YOU RAN THE FULL SCRIPT!!!

Please copy the TTF Essential Font Pack from Extras into `/usr/share/fonts/` Open the folder as Administrator. This is required to perform these actions as this is modifying files on the system level. https://mega.nz/folder/4Rw3xb4K#6VB4b8WRnCUO3UMLNKdVXw

Backup of home folder is for files only. Settings must be set manually. There are only some special case exceptions to this.
